systemd mode
============

Major mode for editing systemd units in GNU Emacs.  See the commentary
in `systemd.el`.

Installation
------------

Available as the `systemd` package on MELPA <http://melpa.org/> and
marmalade <https://marmalade-repo.org/>.

In Emacs, one can locally install as a package with `make dist` and

  M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/systemd-VERSION.tar RET

Otherwise, for either installing into one's `load-path` or a system
install, do the usual

  make
  make install
